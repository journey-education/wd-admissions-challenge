## Getting Started

### Learning the Basics

- [flexboxfroggy.com](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)

### Building your Project with CodeSandbox

You will be building your project with an app called codesandbox. To get started:

- Create an account here:  https://codesandbox.io/signin
- Once signed in, go to this URL https://codesandbox.io/s/tech-challenge-toystory-4-xfbd7 
- Create a copy of this project by clicking "file" --> "Fork Sandbox" 
- This is where you will build out your project

## Advice

- Take some time to look over the provided content and mockups. Here is a gif to give you a better idea of what the actual page looks like.

- We‚Äôve added color codes, and other CSS values that you will need in the styles.css file.
- All of the images you will need are in the images folder.
- All of the text you will need is in the content.md file.
- The fonts are already being imported and are available for use in the css file.
- Get as far as you can. This challenge is meant to be difficult and provide you with a challenge that should test your limits.
- Keep in mind that there are many ways of completing the project. Everyone will have a different solution. As long as the rendered page looks like the provided mockup and you haven‚Äôt gone against any explicit ‚Äúdon‚Äôts‚Äù, you should be fine.

## Submitting your Work

In order to submit your work, please save your project in codesandbox and email the URL to your learning advisor.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your learning advisor will specify how long you have to complete and submit your admissions challenge. Once we review your work, we will reach out (typically within a day or two) to let you know the next steps.

## Do This

- Do remember what stumped you and problems you had and be prepared to talk about them during your interview.
- Do have the grit to find solutions online. Not every search result will be a winner, but if you persevere, all the answers you need are available online.
- Do be aware that we will be questioning you on your code and the thought that went into it.
- Do write all of the HTML and CSS yourself.
- Do use vanilla JavaScript. This means just plain ol‚Äô JS without any frameworks or libraries.
- Do use Flexbox for your layout.

## Don't do This

- Don‚Äôt worry about creating a pixel-perfect reproduction of the mockup.
- Don‚Äôt try to learn everything there is to know about HTML, CSS and JS. There is way too much to learn and that is what we are here to help with!
- Don‚Äôt copy code from outside sources. The code should be your own.
- Don‚Äôt use any CSS framework to complete your project.
- Don‚Äôt use jQuery.
- Don't use tables in your code.
